<p>Personal Information </p>

<p>Greeting's! my name is Darren Jonathan Lucky. My student number in RMIT is s3879744 and my email address is <a  href="mailto:s38798744@student.rmit.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >s38798744@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. I am Indonesian and I enjoy playing games, meeting new people, learning something new, exercising and learning about cars, whether it is their history or their performance. A weird fact of my life is that I have a fear of small holes, in other words, I am tropophobia, which is why I can’t really stand looking at beehives for too long and I also hate tomato sauce and mayonnaise on my food, even though I don’t mind eating burgers and pizza. Maybe it is because, I couldn’t really taste it. I also have two dogs, one is a Shitsu, who is about 10 years old by this year and the other is a hybrid of a pom-pom and a golden retriever, who is recently 1 year old. My main language is English, and I also can speak Indonesian and Chinese. Now, I am currently studying at RMIT University. I am studying Bachelor of IT and I am enjoying my experience at RMIT. The teachers and classmates are kind to me, and I am now doing a project from RMIT.  </p>

<p>Interest in IT </p>

<p>My interest in IT started when I was still in primary school, and from there my interest grew. I began learning about databases, learning about the computer parts and when I attended foundation school, I learn about programming, making a game using Scratch and various other topics that I am eager to learn. I chose RMIT Melbourne for my university, because I feel like RMIT can provide the best sources for me to expand my passion with IT and it can potentially help me understand the topics that I couldn’t really understand back during my school years. I also feel like RMIT can also help me learn new topics, such as 3D printing, which is something I really want to learn. I always want to learn how to 3D print, and I feel like RMIT is the perfect place to learn. My goal for my time in RMIT is to expand my knowledge in the world of IT, meet new people from all over the world, but my prime objective in RMIT is for experience. I am curious how life is like in RMIT university, and I would love to be part of this amazing community. </p>

<p>Ideal job </p>

<p>For my ideal job, I found an advertisement from seek.com.au asking for a 3D printing technician to help with their business. The link to the webiste is <a  href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51638553?type=standard#searchRequestToken=3e18dae9-e76e-4edc-9642-fbd6171e7240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >https://www.seek.com.au/job/51638553?type=standard#searchRequestToken=3e18dae9-e76e-4edc-9642-fbd6171e7240</a> and it requires me to have knowledge of using “Fusion 360” and a file management system known as “3Dxpert”. I was really appealed to the job because I am very interested in this job primarily because I don’t have any experience with a job like this, so this could be a start for my own business venture with 3D printing. Now before I began taking a job like this, I will need a lot of skills for me to learn how to use 3D printing, so that is why I will need some time at RMIT for me to learn how I can use 3D printing and to learn 3D printing in my own spare time as well. </p>

<p>Personal Profile </p>

<p>I have taken three online tests, which are 16personalities.com, an online learning test called “how-to-study.com” and a website called BigFivePersonality.com. According to 16personalities.com, my mind is 54% extroverted, while 46% introverted. My energy is 43% intuitive and 57% observant. My nature is 37% thinking and 63% feeling. My tactics are 49% judging and 51% prospecting and mt identity is 35% assertive and 65% turbulent. From the website known as how-to-study.com, my way of online learning is more auditory and lastly, from the website BigFivePersonality.com, my openness is 69%, my conscientiousness is 52%, extraversion is 37.5%, my agreeableness is 77% and my neuroticism is 62.5% and according to the website, I am an abstract thinker. From what I’ve gathered from these three websites is that I am someone who prefers to study in a more active way rather than passively and I would love to hear feedback on how I can improve my project. I am also more on the feeling side rather than the nature side according to 16personalities.com. I also take an auditory way of learning a subject, so I would hear what the teacher has to say first, but I also prefer an active way of learning, such as writing down notes or taking part in online quizzes. With my skills and how I approach them, I think I am someone who rather listens to what the team has to say and give feedback towards that and if they disagree with my feedback, then I would think about it further with my teammate. </p>

<p>Project Idea </p>

<p>My project will be about 3D printing. This is something that I am eager to learn and have the skill to do. I really want to learn how to 3D print a bunch of props from my favorite games, such as Genshin Impact, Rainbow Six Siege, Payday 2 and much more, and movies, but I want to take my 3D printing skills into the next level and want to 3D print more than just those. I want to 3D print car parts, rocket ship parts and much more. I will use a software known as “Fusion 360” and I will try to see if I can use that software for my 3D printing project. I was really motivated to try this project after seeing a few people on the internet 3D print a few props from my favorite video games and I also saw an article from TopGear talking about this car company called “Czinger” where they are making a car called the “Czinger C21” and its suspension is made from 3D printing. I believe a lot of people in the future will use 3D printing for printing more than just props and car parts, but also parts for robotics, rocket ships and more and I really want to learn how to use 3D printing because of it. I would begin my business by creating a few samples of some video game props that are popular and I would post them online and see if anyone would like for me to create and afterwards, I would do commissions for anyone interested in me 3D printing a few specific items that they will need with their project for a service. I will also offer services to anyone in any types of industry who could use my 3D printing skills, for their projects, if it is something that I familiar with and something that can be done. People ranging from the film industry to the car industry are some of the people I am very keen to work with in the future depending on how successful this business can be. The car industry is an industry I am also very interested in helping, especially because I am a huge fan on cars and would love to help the industry in the form of 3D printing. I would love to help use my 3D printing skills to help print a few car parts, such as the camshaft, headers and more for a few aftermarket companies that would love for me to use my skills to help them with a few car aftermarket parts, as I think that would be a good place to start and afterwards, I would love to help with smaller car companies and then, if all goes well, I think helping big car companies would be something that I really would be happy to help. As for the film industry, I think some movie props is a good idea for me to use my 3D printing skills and for me to use it to make a few props for films. Obviously, the majority of these would take some time and a lot of knowledge on how it is going to work, especially if I am aiming to take part in the car industry. As a result, I would be offering people my services in exchange of money. As of right now, I am not certain how much my services will cost, because I don’t really know how the business of 3D printing works, but I am certain that it would depend on what exactly I am going to be printing. If it is something that I am familiar and have a lot of knowledge and experience, such as a video game prop or a movie prop, like a prop gun, then the price for me to 3D print wouldn’t be too expensive, but if it is something that I am not familiar with and something that will take a lot of time and money, then the price needed for my service would be very expensive obviously. For now, this is how my service is going to be if it turns out successful, but for now I will just be doing commissions for anybody interested and from that point onwards, I will see where the future will hold for my 3D printing business. Obviously, I will need a lot of time and patience for me to learn how to use 3D printing, especially if I am going to start my business, but without any experience, so I will be using “Fusion 360” as I mentioned earlier. Apparently according to the website, I would need to pay a fee for me to use the software and my own 3D printer, if I am ever going to start my own 3D printing business. Hence that is why I will be start using RMIT’s 3D printer, for me to get used to how to 3D print and from that point, once I have enough funds, I would need my very own 3D printer, for me to expand my business. If this project will be successful, I think I would love to expand my business further from just making video game props and car parts, my end goal is to use my 3D printing skills to help all types of industry all over the world and to help solve some potential issues with 3D printing, such as the time constraint and because 3D printing is a relatively new project, the cost will be very expensive, so my other goal is to help reduce the price of 3D printing and teach new people why I enjoy 3D printing and help them like 3D printing so much, they would like to start their own 3D printing business. </p>
